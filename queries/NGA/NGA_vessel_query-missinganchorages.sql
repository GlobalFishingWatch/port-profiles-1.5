## updated query to investigate Jay's concerns with missing anchorages. step 1

--------------------------------------
  -- Query to quantify foreign fishing and carrier vessel visits and unique vessels visiting Nigeria ports.
  --
  -- there is a need to identify visits that follow significant voyages
  -- meaning voyages on which some activity occured rather than situations where a
  -- vessel leaves a port and then immediately returns. This is currently identified
  -- in several ways...

  -- 1. if the start and end 'port' are the
  --    the same, the voyage must have an
  --    encounter, loitering event, or fishing
  --    event
  -- 2. if the start and end port are different
  --    the voyage must be longer than 1 hour
  -- 3. if the start and end 'port are the
  --    same and there is no event the voyage
  --    is at least 12 hours
  -- 4. voyages where the longest port visit
  --    stop/gap is "long enough" (3
  --    hours currently)

## set time frame of interest
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION  start_date() AS (TIMESTAMP('2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC'));
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION  start_year() AS (2021);
  # voyages will be truncated to this end timestamp, if needed
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION  end_date() AS (TIMESTAMP('2023-12-31 23:59:59 UTC'));
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION  end_year() AS (2023);

## set port and country (iso) of interest
-- CREATE TEMP FUNCTION port_label() AS (CAST("CONAKRY" AS STRING));
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION port_iso() AS (CAST("NGA" AS STRING));

## save table if needed:
CREATE or replace TABLE `world-fishing-827.scratch_joef.testing_missed_anchorages_NGA` AS
