Description: Geometry shapes in 'R' are typically represented by matrices (points, lines), with more complex 
  shapes being lists of matrices (polygons). 'Geometries' will convert various 'R' objects into these shapes. 
  Conversion functions are available at both the 'R' level, and through 'Rcpp'.
