pre-commit \>= 2.11.0 supports R as a language and each hook repo has
its own virtual environment with package versions locked. For that
reason, we should also test with exactly these versions.

This package has five testing workflows:

-   hook testing. Tests the hooks (as well as hook script helpers?) in
    the renv in which they'll be shipped. No R CMD Check or pre-commit
    executable needed. All platforms. To avoid convolution of the
    testing environment (that contains testthat and other packages) and
    the hook environment (specified in `renv.lock`), we must only
    activate the hook environment right when the script is called, but
    `run_test()` must run in the testing environment. Since `--vanilla`
    is inherited in the child process initiated from `run_test()`, the
    only way to do this is to set an env variable when running
    `run_test()` and check in the user R profile if it is set, and then
    activate the renv. This is done with `R_PRECOMMIT_HOOK_ENV`.

-   Legacy hook testing: It is possible that someone updates the R
    package {precommit}, but not the hook revision (e.g. with
    `precommit::autoupdate()`) or vice versa. If the hook revision is
    updated to `>= 0.2.0`, all hook scripts and {precommit} functions
    called from the hook script are from the same version of
    {precommit}, so we don't need to test hook compatibility. If the R
    package is updated but not the hook revision, old hook scripts are
    called with while the {precommit} functions in them are from a new
    package version. Hence, we need compatibility between new packages
    and old hook scripts, which is exactly what is tested with this
    workflow. Until there are breaking changes in the *hook script
    helpers* family of exported functions, there should not be a
    problem.

-   complete testing: Tests hooks as well as usethis like access
    functionality with latest CRAN packages, on all platforms, with all
    installation methods.

-   CRAN testing. On CRAN, complete testing is ran, tests that check
    pre-commit executable access are disabled.

-   end-2-end testing: This simulates closely what happens when you run
    `git commit` with pre-commit activated: We update the
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the pushed SHA and run
    `pre-commit run`, covering all hooks, to ensure in particular file
    linking, file permissions etc. in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` are
    correct for exported hooks.
