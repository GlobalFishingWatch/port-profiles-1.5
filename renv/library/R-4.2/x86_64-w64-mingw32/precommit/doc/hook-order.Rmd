Read only hooks should generally run only after write hooks.

## Rules for editing this document

-   Only add a dependency once, i.e. if styler must run before roxygen, add the requirement to styler or roxygen, not both. This makes keeping track easier.
-   The hooks must appear in an order that meets all constraints, not just randomly order constraints.

## Hooks with dependencies:

**Read and write**

-   styler: should run before roxygen because of caching. Caches.
-   roxygen. Caches.
-   codemeta: must be before tidy description.
-   use-tidy-description.

**Just read:**

-   spell check; run after roxygen
-   lintr: should run after styler.
-   readme-rmd-rendered: Must run after styler.
-   parsable-R
-   no-browser-statement
-   deps in desc.
